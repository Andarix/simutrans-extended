<em>Signals in Simutrans Extended</em><br>
Signals in Simutrans Extended is a very complex subject. The signals have evolved from Simutrans Standard and have become quite different, both in functionallity and appearence. A signal can be many things dependent on how the signal has been designed for the pakset and in some cases, a signal variant doesnt exist in some pakset while it exists in another. This signal help section will aim to describe all of the possible variants that is possible and how they would work in the game.<br>
A signal in Simutrans Extended will have some fundamental parameters which will be described shortly on this page. To read further on some of the subjects follow the links under the subjects to get a more indepth description.


<em>Working methods</em><br>
Since the dawn of railways, the biggest problem has always been to ensure that two trains are not running into each other. This has resulted in the development of various safety systems, rules, technical safety instruments etc.<br>
Signals in Simutrans Extended are working with so called "working methods", which will determine how the signal behaves and which rules and "safety systems" the train will follow after passing the signal. The working method is the most essential parameter of the signal, as all other functionallity will depend on it. Different working methods represents different real life rail systems, and there are different signals available to the various working methods.<br>
Whenever a train leaves a depot or platform with no signals, it will default to the Drive by Sight working method (although with some exceptions: se the link below).<br>

<em>Signalboxes</em><br>
A signal can't just be built as a standalone signal: They need signalboxes in order to be built. A signalbox is in the real world the shelf or the building from which the signals are controlled. Newer techniques allows for more efficient signal systems with greater numbers and more remote controlled signals. In Simutrans, different signalboxes allows for different signals, simulating the different eras and techniques.<br>
To build and connect signals to signal boxes, start by placing a signalbox next to the track. Once the signalbox is built, a bunch of signals will become visible in the rail toolbar which will now automatically be connected to your newly built signalbox when built. If you want to build new signals to another signalbox on your map, click on that signalbox and new signals will automatically be connected to that one.<br><br>

<em>Uni- and bidirectional signals</em><br>
Signals are unidirectional signals by default that only interact with trains they are facing, meaning that trains passing in the opposite direction will ignore the signal completely.<br>
Some working methods, however, allow signals to become bidirectional signals, controling traffic from both directions. To create a bidirectional signal, click multiple times with the signal building tool on the signal, and the signal will circle between being unidirectional in one way, the other way and eventually bidirectional.<br>
The "station signal" though can only be built as a bidirectional signal.<br><br>

<em>Normal reservations and Directional reservations</em><br>
As opposed to a normal reservation, it is possible for a signal also to create a directional reservation. A directional reservation reserves only the direction of the track, not the track itself. Therefore other trains can still enter the directionally reserved track, but only travel in the same direction as the track is reserved. With the block reservation tool, the directional reservation has the color BLUE, and normal reservation has the color RED. To see what direction the reservation is, open the track info window.<br>
To create a directinal reservation you need to put either a bidirectional signal, or a longblock signal. Read more about that here: <a href="signals_usage.txt">Signals usage</a><br><br>

<em>Sighting distance</em><br>
The traindriver can only see a certain distance in front of the train. When a train is in the "drive by sight" working method, the sighting distance is the only safety feature in existance and the train is therefore required to drive slow enough to stop within the sighting distance.<br>
The sighting distance is also used to determine the speed that a train will approach an upcoming signal. Since the train does not know the state of an upcoming signal (except in "cab signal" and "moving block" working methods), it must drive slow enough to possibly stop if the signal is at danger. To come around this problem, presignals is used, which tells the driver at a much earlier point what state the upcoming signal is at.<br>

<em>Signals max speed</em><br>
At higher speeds, signs and signals get more difficult to read. Each signal has a maximum sighting speed (defined as "Max speed") which is the maximum speed that the traindrivers human eye can read the messages given from the signal. In effect, this means that a train will not pass a signal at higher speed than the signals maxspeed. Although with modern technology cab signalling allows the signal states to be shown inside the cab of the trains, thus allowing for a higher sighting speed, as it is the technology that "sees" the signal.<br><br>

<em>Multiple aspect signals</em><br>
A signal may have up to 5 aspects, in addition to aspects for permissive signals and choose signals showing alternative routes. Not all paksets make use of all of the aspects and the graphics of the signals might be very different between paksets.<br>
The core function of such signals is to rize the density of the tracks. The more aspects, the smaller blocks of tracks one can create without compromizing with lower top speeds, thus creating room for more trains on the tracks. Therefore, the most effective way of using multi aspect signals are at lines with a big traffic demand.

<em>Choose signals</em><br>
Choose signals serves two functions: They will guide the train to an empty platform at the station, and they will guide a train through a station, also if the mainline route is occupied.<br>
To make use of this second function, you need to place an <it>end of choose </it>sign outside all the exits of the station. When a train aproach the choose signal, it will be given a route all the way till its destination or the "end of choose" sign, whichever is encountered first.<br>

<em>Permissive signals</em><br>
Permissive signals are used to increase line capacity. When a train is brought to a stand at a permissive signal at danger, it may proceed beyond the signal at "drive by sight". This is only possible where the signal controls a section of straight, unidirectional track. If there are junctions, the permissive functionality is disabled and the signal works as an ordinary signal.<br>
