<em>How to build a signal</em><br>
Many signals need to be connected to a signalbox. Therefore you have to build a signalbox first in order to see what signals you can build with that signalbox. The signals will stay hidden in the menu until "their" signalbox has been built and selected on the map.<br>
* To build a signal, first choose the appropriate signalbox in the menu and build it somewhere near the track<br>
* Alternatively, open the info window for an existing signalbox on the map.<br>
* When the signalbox is built or selected, it will automatically be set to the "default" signalbox from which to build new signals<br>
* The menu should automatically update with the signals that can be built with this signalbox<br>
* Now build the signal you want. Take into account the max distance both for the signalbox and the signal as well as the signalcount in the signalbox<br>
<br><br>

<em>How to reassign existing signals to a different signalbox</em><br>
* Open the "Special Construction Tools" dialog<br>
* Press the "Reassign Signal" tool<br>
* Press on the signal you want to reassign<br>
* Press on the signalbox you want the signal to reassign to<br><br>
Alternatively, you can reassign all signals from one signalbox to another:<br>
* Open the "Special Construction Tools" dialog and press the "Reassign Signal" tool<br>
* Press on the signalbox from which you want to move all signals from<br>
* Press on the signalbox you want all of the signals to be moved to<br>
* A message will show up if any of the transfers did not succeed<br>
<br><br>

<em>How to create a directional reservation (BLUE reservation)</em><br>
It is only certain signals or combination of signals that will create a directional reservation. These kinds of signals will create the directional reservation directly:<br>
* <it>Longblock signals</it><br>
* <it>Station signals</it> using <it>Time interval with telegraph</it> working method<br><br>

This combination of signals will also create a directional reservation:<br>
* <it>Track circuit</it> working method signal followed by a bidirectional <it>Track circuit</it> signal<br>
* <it>Cab signalling</it> working method signal followed by a bidirectional <it>Cab signalling</it> signal<br>
* <it>Moving block</it> working method signal followed by a bidirectional <it>Moving block</it> signal<br><br>

To end a directional reservation place a:<br>
* Oneway sign<br>
* A signal with a working method different than mentioned above<br>
<br><br>


<em>What does the aspects mean?</em><br>
The meaning of some aspects will change slightly dependent on what working method is used, but for most signals this is the meaning:<br>
1 - <it>DANGER</it>: Stop in front of signal<br>
2 - <it>CLEAR</it>: Proceed, if signal is a multiple aspect signal, expect next signal(s) to be at clear<br>
3 - <it>CAUTION</it>: Proceed, but next signal will be at danger<br>
4 - <it>PRELIMINARY CAUTION</it>: Proceed, but second next signal will be at danger<br>
5 - <it>ADVANCED CAUTION</it>: Proceed, buth third next signal will be at danger<br><br>

For Time interval signals and Time interval with telegraph signals the meaning will change slightly:<br>
1 - <it>DANGER</it>: Less than 5 in-game minutes since last train: Stop<br>
2 - <it>CAUTION</it>: More than 5 minutes since last train: Proceed at half line speed or half the signal's sighting speed<br>
3 - <it>CLEAR</it>: More than 10 minutes since last train: Proceed at full speed<br><br>

Choose signals might have a combination from above as well as some specific choose signals aspects:<br>
1 - <it>(main route)</it>: Proceed to the scheduled platform / Proceed via the main route through the station<br>
2 - <it>(subsidiarey route)</it>: Scheduled platform occupied, proceed to an alternate platform / Main route through station occupied, proceed via an alternate route<br><br>

Permissive signals will have this specific aspect in addition to the above:<br>
1 - <it>CALL ON</it>: Track ahead is occupied, proceed with "Drive by sight" working method<br><br>

Distant signals will only have two aspects in total. They are:<br>
1 - <it>CAUTION</it>: Expect next signal to be at danger<br>
2 - <it>CLEAR</it>: Expect next signal to be at clear. For Absolute block signals, it means that all signals connected to the same signalbox ahead are clear<br>
<br><br>

<em>What is a "Vane" signal?</em><br>
A Vane signal is another name for stop signal which uses either the <it>Time interval</it> or the <it>Time interval with telegraph</it> working method.<br>
<br><br>

<em>How to see what features a signal has</em><br>
The most important features of a signal are listed when you hover with the mouse over the signal icon. Another way is to build the signal and open its infowindow.<br>
