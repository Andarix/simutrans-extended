<title>Signals placement</title>

<h1>Signals placement</h1><br>
<p>

The placement of signals is very different depending on what situation you have and what kinds of signals you have to your disposal. Choosing the correct signal layout can be quite tricky, as well as there allways will be more ways it can be signalled. This will function as a basic guide as to what signals you need to use in which situations.<br>
In general, later era signals can almost at any time replace older era signals, although not in all circumstances.<br><br><br>


<em>Double tracked line:</em><br>
Double tracked lines are in principle the most easy way to operate a railroad, with one direction on one track, and the other direction on the other track. Trains can operate in the "Drive by sight" working method and the only thing you definitively need is one way signs to prevent trains going in the wrong direction. However, there are some equipment to be used that makes it a bit more efficient:<br>
<it>Drive by sight</it>: You probably need some signals, like absolute block signals, on the station to avoid deadlocks in the track switches, but otherwise you only need to place a "drive by sight" sign outside the furthest point from the station along with the one way signs.<br>
<it>Time interval</it>: Using this working method will space the trains out so they keep a distance to each other. If you have the station signal at your disposal, you can put one at any of the platforms (only one pr station is needed) and a choose signal outside the furthest track switch facing the other way. You can also place normal time interval signals at the platform ends instead of the station signal. You can place some time interval signals along the line in order to keep trains separated on very long stretches, which can be usefull if your trains run tightly or you have trains with different speeds running on the track.<br>
<it>Absolute block</it>: This working method will ensure that there are never more than one train in any block. You put a signal on every platform end, and on the line, a signal for every block you want. Typically, you would place small posts along the track evenly spaced out. The post would be a small signal box with just a handfull signals, 2 normal signals and 1 presignal in each direction. The two normal signals are placed one train length apart, while the presignal should be placed quite a bit further ahead of the first normal signal (read below about presignals). If more capacity is needed and you have acces to the intermediate signals, you can place such a pair of signals (one presignal and one normal stopsignal) as far in front of the signalbox as possible, or as far behind the signalbox as possible. Note that only one pair can be supported by the signalbox.<br>
<it>Track circuit block, Cab signal</it> and <it>Moving block</it>: This is very straight forward. As with the absolute block signals, you put these signals at the platform ends and on the line. The closer you put them, the smaller the blocks become and the higher capacity your line will get. If you use the track circuit block signals, you might come to a point where presignal and stopsignal needs to be in the same place, and so you can start using multiple aspect signals instead of normal signals. Read below about presignals and how far away from their main signal they should stand. Cab signals and moving block dont use presignals at all, thus not needing multiple aspect signalling either. If you use moving block signals, you place them according to the maximum distance between moving block signals.

<em>Single tracked line:</em><br>
When you have a single tracked line between two stations, you have three choices: "Time interval with telegraph" working method, "Token Block" working method or Directional reservations.<br>
<it>Time interval with telegraph</it>: If you have acces to the station signal, you can place a station signal on any of the platforms (only one pr station is needed) and a choose signal outside the furthest track switch facing the other way. If you have intermediate stops with no passing loops, you should place a station signal on each stop. All this will result in a directional reservation from the station signal until the next signal, which should be the choose signal to the next station.<br>
If you have a big station and dont want to operate it using a station signal, you can place normal time interval with telegraph signals on each platform ends, alternatively on some passing loops sticking out from the station. Those will create no directional reservations, but will actually reserve the track (if there are any track switches up until the fortcoming signal). If there are any intermediate stops on the way with a station signal, a directional reservation will be made behind that.<br>
<it>Token block</it>: You might have two choices if you have acces to double block signals. If you have such signals, you put them as the platform signal, alternatively the station signal, and place a token block signal on the line, just outside the furthest track switch of your station. Next to the token block signal, but in the other direction, you put an absolute block choose signal.
If you do not have double block signals, you have to build a passing loop out from the station on the single tracked line and place the token block signal at the far end on one of the tracks. On the other track you build a choose signal facing the other direction. Also, put one way signs on both tracks as to force the trains to use the correct tracks.<br>
<it>Directional reservations</it>: Directional reservations can be managed in many ways. Already one way has been mentioned with the "Time interval with telegraph" working method, however there are easier ways to create the directional reservation if you have acces to the signals.
Using either the "Track circuit block" or the "cab signal" working method, you put stop signals on all the platform ends, and then you make the first signal on the single line stretch bidirectional. Just outside the furthest track switch you set a choose signal facing the other direction to let trains enter the station. This will ensure that a train attempting to leave the station will not leave unless it can reserve the track to the next signal (which is bidirectional) and create a directional reservation through all forthcoming signals all the way to the firstcoming choose signal (or one way sign).<br>
The "moving block" working method functions in around the same way: You make sure that the first moving block signal or -beacon is bidirectional, and a directional reservation is made to the next choose signal (or one way sign)<br><br><br>


<em>Single track dead end:</em><br>
Sometimes your railway network ends up in just a single tracked dead end with no passing loops or multiple platform stations. In such circumstanses the most easy thing to use is a "one train staff" cabinett.
Like with the "token block" signals, you have two ways of creating such an entry, wether you have acces to double block signals or not. If you have such signals, you put them as the platform signal, alternatively the station signal, and place the one train staff cabinett on the line, just outside the furthest track switch of your station. Next to the one train staff cabinett, but in the other direction, you put an absolute block choose signal.
If you do not have double block signals, you have to build a passing loop out from the station on the single tracked line and place the one train staff cabinett at the far end on one of the tracks BUT, also one on the other track next to the first one. Those two will build a pair so the train can give back the staff to the cabinett. On the other track you might also build a choose signal facing the other direction for the train to choose a platform when it is returning. Also, put one way signs on both tracks as to force the trains to use the correct tracks.<br>
It is very important when using one train staff cabinetts that the staff gets returned at the same cabinett it was retrieved or another cabinett on an adjecent tile.<br><br><br>


<em>Single track railway line with only one train:</em><br>
Sometimes you only need a single line of track between two points with no connections what so ever to the rest of the railway layout. In such circumstances it is recommended only to use a one train staff cabinett, placing it on the small lump of track going between the line and the depot. The train will pick up the staff on its way from the depot, and will keep it, and the right to drive at full speed, in its position until it returns to the depot, passing the one train staff cabinett again.<br><br><br>


<em>Presignals:</em><br>
Presignals are used to warn the train of the status of an upcoming signal, however they function in two different ways.<br>
<it>Absolute block</it>: Presignals in the absolute block working method will remain caution if ANY of the following signals from the same signalbox as the presignal behind the presignal is at danger. So in order for the presignal in the absolute block working method to be clear, all following signals of that signalbox in the trains path must be at clear. To get the most out of such a presignal, it should be placed as the first signal the train will encounter from this signalbox. The distance between the presignal and the next real signal should be longer than the trains braking distance from maximum speed. This will ensure that, in the best case, the train can drive at full speed through the controll area of the signalbox without the need to brake.<br>
<it>The other working methods</it>: In all other working methods the presignal will tell only what the next signal is showing. As with the presignal of the Absolute block working method, the optimum distance any presisignal should be before another signal, is around the length of the longest braking distance from top speed of your trains.<br><br<
